You are a senior QA engineer reviewing the feature described below.
Create a detailed test plan for the "Create New Academic Program" feature.

## Acceptance Criteria
Scenario: Navigate to program creation form
  Given I am logged in as admin
  When I navigate to the Programs page
  And I click "+ New Program"
  Then I see the program creation form with fields: Program Name, Description

Scenario: Successfully create a program
  Given I am on the program creation form
  When I fill in Program Name with "Web Development 2026"
  And I fill in Description with "Full-stack web development program"
  And I click Create
  Then the modal closes
  And the program list shows "Web Development 2026"

Scenario: Validation prevents empty program name
  Given I am on the program creation form
  When I leave the Program Name field empty
  Then the Create button is disabled

## Requirements for the test plan
- Cover every acceptance criterion with at least one test case
- Add edge cases the ACs don't mention (boundary values, empty inputs,
  special characters, duplicate data, max-length inputs)
- Add negative test cases (what should NOT happen)
- Structure each test case as:
  - ID (TC-001, TC-002, etc.)
  - Title (describes the expected behavior)
  - Preconditions
  - Steps (numbered)
  - Expected result
  - Priority (High / Medium / Low)
- Group test cases by: Positive flows, Negative flows, Edge cases
- At the end, list any ambiguities or gaps you found in the acceptance criteria

## Output
- Return a structured test plan in Markdown
- Be specific — use real field names and values, not generic placeholders
