# CI Failure Triage

## Steps
1. Pull the failed run's logs + playwright-report artifact (GitHub MCP / gh CLI).
2. Read the Playwright error: failing test, expected vs received, trace path.
3. Cross-reference: the spec, the POM, and the Didaxis source in the repo.
4. Classify: real app bug (route to a Jira bug via jira-bug-reporter) vs
   test issue (propose a patch for human review).
5. Report: post root cause, affected file, expected/actual, suggested fix,
   and evidence (trace/screenshot + run id) as a PR comment.

## Rules
- Never merge a fix automatically — propose, a human approves.
- For a real defect, reuse the jira-bug-reporter skill and link the story.
- The diagnosis must name the source location and cause, not just the symptom.
